I am originally from Peru and I live in Seattle WA. I started my coding journal last year. I was really lucky to go to Coding Dojo Bootcamp, where I have learned three different FULL STACK programming languages and different tools that enhance each of these, like data bases and frameworks. I have worked in a group project called PIX ( inspired by Tumblr), practicing GIT BRANCHING and AGILE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS to facilitate tasks organization, accountability and daily progresses. Next, on my solo project I focus on implementing different API's, writing a DRY code with the help of REACT and usage of different components to make the code REUSABLE and READABLE.
